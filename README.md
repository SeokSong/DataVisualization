This project was done in November of 2018. It was a solo project written in python.
The purpose of the project was to take MLB data and make various graphs to visualize the data better. There are multiple graphs you can select froms, some having cut offs to filter some of the data.
This project was done without any time complexity in mind so the run time is very slow.
